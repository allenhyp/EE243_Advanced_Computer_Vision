function matches = getMatches(featI,featR)

% featI and featR are two feature matrices of dim N1 x n_feat and N2 x n_feat respectively.
% matches is a N x 2 matrix indicating the indices of matches. N <= % min(N1,N2). 
% For e.g. if featI(i,:) matches with featR(j,:), then matches should have [i,j] as one of its row.
